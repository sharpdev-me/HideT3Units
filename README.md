# HideT3Units

This is a simple mod for my [SNKRX modloader](https://github.com/sharpdev-me/SNKMD)! All it does is
prevent max-level units from appearing in the shop.

## Installing

Follow the install instructions for the [SNKRX modloader](https://github.com/sharpdev-me/SNKMD). Then, download this repository and drag `HideT3Units.zip` to the mods directory (`C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\SNKRX\mods`). Now, just follow the modloader's launch instructions.
